# ETFSD CTF 2021 â€“ Logs

* **Category:** sentinel
* **Points:** 75

## Challenge

> Hoax apparently had a 7 Phantoms FTP server setup on his local network a few months ago that had some important files. For a small price he was persuaded to give us the file name of one of his Powershell log files. Check it out for anything suspicious

File Name: `session-7pftp.log`

## Hints

## Solve

> Check log file for flag
> File Location: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\system\session-7pftp.log`
